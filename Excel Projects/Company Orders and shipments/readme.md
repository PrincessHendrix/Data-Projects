# Orders and Shipment Dashboard for an International E-Commerce Company

### Introduction
An Orders Dashboard is a valuable tool that enables a company’s sales team to assess their sales performance and identify key revenue drivers across product categories, customer segments, regions, and multiple years. By providing these insights, the dashboard helps the team pinpoint areas where sales and marketing efforts should be concentrated to drive revenue growth.

A Shipment Dashboard also allows a company to track its product deliveries based on factors such as shipped products, order priorities, shipping modes, and destination regions. These insights help the company understand shipment patterns, identify backlogs, and evaluate the nature and destinations of incoming orders—ultimately strengthening supply chain operations.

In this project, I created a dashboard for an international e-commerce company, using pivot tables to generate and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs). The dashboard provides a quick and insightful overview of orders and shipments across multiple years, helping the company make informed decisions and align their strategies with business goals.

**Visualized Key Perfomance Indicators(KPIs) Include:**

* Total Revenue by Region
+ Total Revenue by Year
- Revenue by Item Category
* Revenue by Customer Segment
+ Shipments by Order Priority
- Shipments by Shipping Mode

**The Dataset:**
The dataset contains randomly generated data in separate .csv files arranged in terms of months of years. The final dataset is a merged data from all these files and contains 37,289 rows of order data distributed across 9 columns as follows:

| Column | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Order ID | Unique identifiers for orders made |
| Order Date | Date order was made |
| Ship Date | Date order was shipped |
| Ship Mode | Mode of shipment |
| Segment | Type of customer |
| Region | Region order was made from |
| Category | Category of order product |
| Sales | Revenue from the order in USD |
| Order Priority | Urgency of the order |
